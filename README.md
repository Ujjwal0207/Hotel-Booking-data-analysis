# Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a hotel booking dataset containing over 30,000 records to uncover insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, and factors influencing cancellation rates. The findings aim to provide valuable information for hotel management and marketing strategies.

## Project Scope

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

- Explore booking patterns and trends.
- Understand customer preferences.
- Analyze factors influencing booking cancellations.

## Data Preparation

The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and relevance:

- **Missing Value Treatment**: Handled missing values in critical columns, such as agent and company, to maintain dataset integrity.
- **Outlier Removal**: Removed outliers in the Average Daily Rate (ADR) column to enhance the accuracy of the analysis.
- **Dimension Reduction**: Eliminated non-essential columns to streamline the dataset for more efficient analysis.

## Key Findings

- **Cancellation Rate**: Approximately 37% of bookings were canceled, with significant differences observed between hotel types:
  - City Hotels: 45% cancellation rate
  - Resort Hotels: 29% cancellation rate
- **Pricing Trends**: City hotels generally exhibited a higher average daily rate (ADR) than resort hotels, along with clear seasonal pricing fluctuations.

## Visual Analysis

To visualize the findings, the following plots were generated:

- **Bar Plots**: Compared booking and cancellation patterns across different hotel types.
- **Line Plots**: Analyzed ADR trends over time, revealing peak booking seasons and rate variability.

## Tools & Techniques

The following tools and libraries were utilized in the analysis:

- **Data Processing**: Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- **Visualization**: Seaborn and Matplotlib for generating insightful visualizations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Applied EDA techniques to guide further analysis and interpretation of the results.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking data, revealing critical insights that can inform business strategies. The findings highlight significant trends in cancellation rates and pricing, offering actionable recommendations for hotel management.
